# Turtle Type

This is an evil typing test that gives you words to intentionally try and slow you down

`Random` mode gives you random words

`Tricky` mode tries to maximize the distance your fingers travel

`Turtle` mode learns as you type and figures out what letter combinations you struggle with and gives you words that it thinks you will take longer to type. This mode is super adaptive and really smart. If you try doing this mode with only a single finger on your right hand, it'll start giving you words where letters are on opposite ends of the keyboard. If you're bad at typing q's, expect to see a lot of them. If your right hand is faster than your left hand, expect most words to be on the left side of the keyboard
